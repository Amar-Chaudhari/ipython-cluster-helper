## 0.3.0 (August 6, 2014)

- Make a cluster available after a single engine has registered. Avoids need to
  wait for entire cluster to become available on busy clusters.
- Change default SLURM time limit to 1 day to avoid asking for excessive
  resources. This can be overridden by passing `-r` resource with desired runtime.

## 0.2.19 (April 28, 2014)
- Respect RESOURCE_RESERVE_PER_SLOT for LSF. This causes resources to be specified
  at the level of a core instead of a job

## 0.2.18 (April 17, 2014)

- Added ability to get direct view to a cluster.
- Use rusage for LSF jobs instead of --mem. This walls of the memory, preventing nodes
  from being oversubscribed.
